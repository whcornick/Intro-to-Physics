My office hours are Wednesdays 1:00-2:00, or by appointment.\n",

Once the assignment deadline is reached, the copy of your assignment on GitHub will be submitted automatically (other than syncing your Colaboratory copy to GitHub, no additional action is required to submit this assignment).

The easiest way to do this is to open your Google Colaboratory account ([link](https://colab.research.google.com/)) and select your assignment's notebook using the dialogue box.  It should be in the `Recent` tab.  Or, if you've been working on other files, you can navigate to your notebook within the `Google Drive` (all Colaboratory notebooks are stored on your Google Drive space) or `GitHub` tabs.  After saving your changes, simply follow the submission instructions again to re-copy your assignment to GitHub.\n",
